# Circular Experimental Line（Gensokyo Railway Circular Line）Bve Trainsim 5 route
[中文版Readme](https://github.com/noname390/BVE-Gensokyo-Railway/blob/main/README_zh_cn.md)<br>
## Introduction
The Gensokyo Railway Circular Line is a fictional railway line developed by me. It is an imaginary circular railway located in Gensokyo of the Touhou Project,and operated by the fictional company Gensokyo Passenger Railway Corporation.The development of this simulated line was based on the real-life railway system in the Shinetsu region of Japan, which is believed by someone to be the area where Gensokyo exists.<br>
If you are not familiar with the Touhou Project, you can refer to this line as the "Circular Experimental Line" and enjoy it as a general fictional railway.
Currently, the simulated line operates in one direction from the Hakurei Shrine to the Ningennosato, but it will be extended in the future and eventually become a circular line.
